# rollinghunt

Private web app for Rolling Dice Club members to schedule Product Hunt launch days.

## Goal
Today the community coordinates launches via WhatsApp. This app will provide a private, members-only calendar where projects can request and reserve launch dates, and the community can see who to support each day.

## MVP scope (v0)
- Member login (invite-only)
- Projects can request a launch date (calendar)
- Admin/mods approve or manage conflicts
- Daily view: “What are we upvoting today?” (1–2 launches/day)

## Next
- Define roles: member, moderator, admin
- Define scheduling rules (max per day, timezone, cutoffs)
- Pick stack (likely Next.js + Supabase)
