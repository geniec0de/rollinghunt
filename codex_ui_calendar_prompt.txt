- live screenshot: references/screenshots/rollingdiceclub/current_ui.png

Task (strict UI-only):
Focus on design and add a calendar view for launches with a list/calendar toggle. Requirements:
1) Create a calendar component (components/calendar/MonthCalendar.tsx) that displays launches by date in monthly grid, with each day showing 0..N small launch cards (title and owner). Clicking a day opens a side panel with day details.
2) Add a List/Calendar toggle in the dashboard header; default view is List. Persist choice in local state (no backend changes).
3) Style calendar and list to be premium/enterprise-grade, referencing the style tokens: Oxanium headings, primary color #02080F, card surface #FFFFFF with hard shadow, consistent spacing.
4) Keep code minimal and self-contained. Use no heavy third-party calendar libs; implement a lightweight Month grid component with date-fns for date handling.
5) Files to create/modify (only):
   - components/calendar/MonthCalendar.tsx
   - components/calendar/DayPanel.tsx
   - components/dashboard/today-list.tsx (modify to support toggle)
   - app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx (use toggle and calendar)
   - components/ui/card.tsx (ensure supports small variant)
6) Update app/globals.css or tailwind config for calendar-specific tokens (weekday headings, grid gap).
7) Commit locally in a single commit with message: feat(ui): add calendar view + list toggle
8) Write concise JSON report to .codex_last_message.txt with fields: files_changed, screenshot_used, notes, next_steps

Constraints:
- DO NOT change backend or migrations.
