Completed.

- Applied focused UI updates to token mapping and dashboard presentation in:
  - `tailwind.config.ts`
  - `app/globals.css`
  - `components/ui/button.tsx`
  - `components/ui/card.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/today-list.tsx`
  - `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Referenced screenshot at `references/screenshots/rollingdiceclub/current_ui.png`.
- Wrote required JSON report to `.codex_last_message.txt`.
- Created commit: `74bfed6` with message `feat(ui): polish dashboard cards + theme tokens`.

Validation:
- `pnpm lint` could not run because Next.js ESLint setup is interactive in this repo.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` reports pre-existing TypeScript errors outside edited UI files.
