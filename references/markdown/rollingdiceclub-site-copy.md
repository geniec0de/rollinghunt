We continuously launch projects

We focus on problems we personally experience, we test them with landing pages and ads, we solve them with tech.

Our Framework

We don't trust ideas, we trust entrepreneurs

1
Ideation

Phase 1 - The List

Anything

List problems you have yourself, or that you have been heavily confronted to through your surrounding, and put them on a list. Then order them according to the once you can test the fastest

Check on ProductHunt
2
Fake it

Phase 2 - The test

Creative

Forget that you don't have a product, build a support, a landing page, a poster, the most convenient to sell. No Waitlist, No beta, Clear pricing as if the product exist

Test LaunchYet
3
Sell

Phase 3 - The blast

Most important

Bring traffic as if the product exist, let people click on the pricing, on the registration as if the product exist. Stop there, don't take payment.
If enough people arrived here, if you created frustration, you validated your idea, go to next step, otherwise stard from Phase 2 again.

Build it

Phase 4 - The delivery

Start hearing users

You have a winner project, but it's useless if you are not able to build it. Fake it until you make it is beautiful only if you are able to deliver. So start building, give yourself deadlines. Don't keep people waiting on the process too long.

Lovable

Our Mission

Why have we built Rolling Dice?

We wished it existed, so we created it

To Inspire

We will share successful stories of people that got a similar starting point

To Teach

We will show frameworks that worked for us and answer your questions

To Invest

We will invest money on profiles that needs it and that we believe deserve it

Principles

What we stand for

A few principles we have set for ourselves, along the way, to keep us building forward

1
Fail Fast

You’re not supposed to avoid failure you’re supposed to eliminate bad directions early and move on. Fast cycles wins over perfect planing.

2
Play with cards you have in hands

You don’t win by fantasizing about the perfect setup. You move with what’s already in your hands and you use all of it, aggressively.

3
If it's not on your To-do, it's procrastination

Working doesn’t count unless it was on your list. If it wasn’t scheduled it was avoidance.

4
Don't trust your ideas

Numbers > opinions. If there’s no signup, no click, no credit card it’s just theatre. Reality lives in conversion, not conviction.

5
Distribution is the real game

It doesn't exist if it's only in your head. Traffic is the real challenge. Obscurity is the killer.

6
Fake it until you make it

Pre-sell before you build. The product should be sold before it exists. Landing page first product later. With one condition: You are able to do it

Story time

What's better feedback than a life time story ?

While people share feedback here, let me share with you some of our stories

I watched all videos about how Airbnb and others optimized every pixel, I applied it to have the perfect product. Still 3 years after, I failed to find a customer.
So, I learned the importance of selling early

Amine Benjelloun

Failure at getPhotographe 2016

We heard 10% of projects work, we smiled and made a list of 10 projects.
Mailwarm was born from that experience. Selling before building was key.

10% rule at Mailwarm 2020

I want to share my learnings and my framework with builders with similar background, so we can learn together and make an impact
