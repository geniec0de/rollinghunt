# rollinghunt brief

## What we are building
A private, members-only web app for Rolling Dice Club where community members can schedule Product Hunt launch days for their projects.

Today the group coordinates launches via a WhatsApp group (posting 1–2 projects/day to upvote). rollinghunt will replace the WhatsApp scheduling chaos with a clean calendar + approvals, so everyone knows who is launching when and where to focus community attention.

## Non-negotiables
- Match Rolling Dice Club branding: clean, modern, premium, minimal.
- Reuse the same theme language and UI feel (fonts, shadows, spacing, buttons).
- Private access: only community members.

## Core user flows (MVP)
- Member signs in (invite-only)
- Member creates a Project entry
- Member requests a launch date from a calendar
- System enforces rules: max launches per day (likely 1–2)
- Admin/mod approves or resolves conflicts
- Daily page shows “What are we supporting today?” + quick links
